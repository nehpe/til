# Sprouted Potatoes Can Be Poisonous

Potatoes contain glycoalkaloids (natural toxins) called solanine and chaconine.
Both of these cause toxicity through cell disruption leading to gastrointestinal
symtoms. 

There have been very few cases of death from this, but it can cause vomiting,
diarrhea, etc..

Leaves, flowers, "eyes", green skin and sprouts contain the highest concentration
of the toxins. Toxicity is also increased in areas where the potato has been
bruised or contains other discoloration.
